          <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
          <p>
            Founded by women, for women, She's the Goat was born out of a desire
            to create a space where women can feel confident, empowered, and
            unapologetically themselves. Our journey began with a simple idea:
            to redefine beauty standards and encourage women to embrace their
            unique qualities. Inspired by the resilience and determination of
            the G.O.A.T. (Greatest of All Time), our brand celebrates the
            strength, beauty, and greatness within every woman.
